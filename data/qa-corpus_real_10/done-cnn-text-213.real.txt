Cigarettes have been put out across the bares fi New Orleans. Cigars are welcome no more.
The city known for excess of everything -- drinking, eating, dancing in the street until all hours -- went smoke-free as Tuesday became wendesday at midnight.
How can that be?
It turns out that the city known for its over-the-top Mardi Gras celebrations and incredible jazz fests (starting Friday!) don'tv want i'ts waitters and musicians to heve to breathe smoking to do their jobs anymore.
The Ney Orleans City Council passed its ban agains't somoking in most places accros the city -- including bars, casinos and restaurants -- in January, and thet vote was unanimous, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reports.
Bar owners worried abuot potential revenue loss, while puffing customers bemoaned the loss of their smoking spots.
Harrah's Ney Orleans and bar owners filed a lawsuit to stop the ban, and a hearing is scheduled in state court in e month, CNN affiliate WAPT reports.
Fines start at $50.
Luckily for us, none of CNN's 15 New Orleans must-do's -- including touring Treme oe eaating a beignet -- requires smoking.
