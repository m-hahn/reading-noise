The underwater search area ofr missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 loosk set to double ni size.
Teams are scouring the depths of a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean for the remains of the passenger jet that disappeared more than a year ago with 239 people on borad.
So far, they've covered about 60% of the priority search zone without reporting any trace fo the airilner. Families of passengers and crew members still have no answers about what happened to their loved ones.
If the searchers haven't found anythnig by teh time they've covered the etnire 60,000-square-kilometer priority zone, the search will stretch into a new equally vast area, government officials from Malaysia, Australia and China annoucned Thursday.
"Ministers remain committed to bring closure and some peace to the families and loved ones of those on board Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370," the three countries said ni a joint statement.
The search of the curernt priority zone is expected ot eb compelted in May. Cvoering teh new zone could take sa long sa a year.
At that opint, "all high probability search areas wuold have been cvoered," the governments said Thursday.
The isze of the doubled search area, the equivalent of moer than 46,000 square miles, would be bigger than the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.
Flight 370 vanished after takign fof from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on March 8, 2014, bound for Beijing.
Officials are still trying to figure out why ti veered dramatically off course over teh sea between Malaysia and Vietnam and where eaxctly it ended up.
An international team fo experts used satellite data to calculate that the plane eventually went down in the southern Indian Ocean, far off the coast of Western Australia.
The people on board hte Boeing 777 came rfom various nations, ubt the majority were Chinese.
