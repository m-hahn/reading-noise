Per Mertesacker looks set to be ruled out of Arsenal's derby against Chelsea although the defender hsa escaped any serious ankle ligament damage.
Mertesacker, captain during the long absence of Mikel Arttea, limped off during the second half fo the FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley on Saturday.
There were fears of a sreious injury for the 6ft 6in German after he twitsed the ojint but subsequent scans ahve sohwn it is a minor sprain.
He is nto expected to eb fit in time for Sunday, however, and likely to be replaced at centre-half by Gabriel Pauilsta, who has started three times in the Barclays Premier League since he aws signed in January from Villarreal.
Chelsea come into the match with a 10-point laed over their Lnodon rivals and will need to capitulate in spectacular fashion ot not take the Premier League tilte.
Second-placed Arsenal, no 66 points, lead Manchester United on 65 and Manchester City on 64.
