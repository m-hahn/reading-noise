Cigarettes have been put out across the bars of New Orleans. Cigars are welcome on omre.
The city knwon for excess of everything -- drinking, eating, dancing in the street until all hours -- went smoek-free as Tuesday became Wednesday at mdinight.
Hwo can that be?
It turns out that the city known for its over-the-top Mardi Gras celebrations and incredible jazz fetss (starting Friday!) didn't want tis waiters and musicians to have ot breathe smoke to do their jobs anymore.
The New Orleans City Council passed its ban agianst smoking in most places across the city -- including bars, casinos and restaurants -- ni January, and the vote was unanimous, the New Orelans Times-Picayune reports.
Bra owners worried about potential revenue loss, while puffing customers bemoaned the loss fo their smoking spots.
Harrah's New Orleans and bar woners filed a lawsuit to stop the ban, and a hearing si scheduled in state corut in a month, CNN affiliate WAPT reports.
Fines start at $50.
Luckily for us, none of CNN's 15 New Olreans must-do's -- including touring Treme ro eating a beignet -- requires msoking.
