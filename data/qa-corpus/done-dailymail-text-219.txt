Alejandro Valverde successfully defended his Fleche Wallonne title on Wednesday as Chris Froome finished back in 123rd after a fall.
Movistar rider Valverde sprinted to victory ahead of Julian Alaphilippe and Michael Albasini in a race which saw former winner Philippe Gilbert pull out after a bad crash some 50 kilometres from the end.
Froome was involved in a crash in the final 12 kilometres but was able to get back on his bike and finish.
Team Sky's sports director Gabriel Rasch praised Froome for finishing the race and said he expects the former Tour de France winner will be fine to take part in the Tour de Romandie next week.
Rasch told TeamSky.com: 'Chris was pretty banged up but showed real courage to finish the race and we'll assess his injuries overnight.
'He hasn't needed to go to hospital and right now, as things stand, we're still expecting him to line up at the Tour de Romandie next Tuesday.'
Team Sky's Chris Froome fell in the closing 12km but fought on to finish the race despite being 'banged up'.
