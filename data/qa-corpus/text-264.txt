This is the shocking moment a pit crew member was hit by a car on Sunday during the inaugural IndyCar Grand Prix of Louisiana.
Todd Phillips, a front-outside tire changer for Dayle Coyne Racing, was injured when he was struck by the car of Francesco Dracone, who had come in on Lap 25 for tyres and fuel.
Dracone spun while exiting his put box, clipping Phillips' leg.
Phillips was taken to the infield care center for treatment where he has received stitches for a cut on his leg and has been released.
Many cars struggled with traction during the race after rain had fallen for hours leading up to the green flag.
Dracone did not finish the race and wound up 23rd.
