A man was horrified after finding a five inch piece of TIMBER in his frozen curry.
John Foran's wife Nita was preparing a chicken tikka biryani stir-fry on Tuesday April 7 when he found the splinter-covered shard.
The £2 ready meal was bought from an Iceland Foods store in Spytty Retail Park near the couple's home in Newport, South Wales, within the last two weeks.
John, 59, said: 'When it fell out of the bag I couldn't believe it.
'As Nita was putting it in the stir fry dish, she thought it was just a big bit of veg.
'It was a piece of wood with splinters coming off it.
'I just don't understand how it got inside.'
Shocked John immediately contacted Iceland who are currently investigating the matter.
He said: 'It may only have been £2 but that's beside the point.
'Things like this should not be in your food.
'I contacted Iceland and all they said was take it back to the shop and that they'll be in touch.
'But I want people to know what could be hiding in their meal.'
An Iceland spokeswoman said: 'Please be assured that we take all complaints extremely seriously. We can confirm that Mr Foran has now been in touch with our customer care department regarding the foreign body found in his ready meal.
'Mr Foran is returning the item to the store and the foreign body will be collected by our supplier in order for them to carry out a thorough investigation. As soon as we have the results of this investigation we will get back in touch with Mr Foran.'
